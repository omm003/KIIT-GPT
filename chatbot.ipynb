In 2017 it was renamed Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology following the UGC order to drop the term \"University\" from the name for all the institutes granted the status of \\'Deemed to be Universities\\'.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nKIIT was established in 1992 as an Industrial Training Institute with only twelve students and two faculty. It is part of KIIT Society which is estimated to be worth US$1.3 billion as of 2020. In 1997, the School of Technology and the School of Computer Application were established. In 2004 it was conferred the status of deemed university and renamed KIIT University.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2018 Student clashes ===\\nIn November 2018, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Bhubaneswar experienced significant campus unrest due to violent clashes between student groups. The conflict reportedly began when law students objected to lewd comments being made to a female law student, leading to escalating tensions. On November 24, approximately 300 to 400 engineering students engaged in aggressive actions, including stone-pelting and assaults with wooden sticks, resulting in injuries to over 25 law students. The situation prompted authorities to evacuate nearly all 400 law students and several engineering students from the campus to prevent further violence. In response, the Infocity police detained five students and registered two cases related to the incident. The university administration also vacated two hostels as a precautionary measure, while clarifying that classes for various schools continued as scheduled. \\n\\n\\n=== Death of Prakriti Lamsal and subsequent controversy ===\\n\\nDeath of Prakriti Lamsal and Aftermath\\nOn 16 February 2025, Nepalese BTech student Prakriti Lamsal was found dead in her KIIT hostel, with media reporting suspicions of harassment and emotional blackmail by a fellow student, leading to police arrest and widespread campus protests.  \\nKIIT initially directed over 1,100 Nepali students to vacate campus, which drew criticism and intervention from Nepal’s government; the order was later rescinded following protests.  \\nVideos showing KIIT security staff manhandling protesting students and making derogatory remarks about Nepal emerged, prompting apologies, staff suspensions, and an apology from the Vice‑Chancellor.  \\nState authorities established a fact‑finding committee, and the NHRC and Odisha High Court intervened amid ongoing investigation. \\n\\n\\n=== Death of Nepali Student in May 2025 ===\\nOn May 1, 2025, a female student from Nepal was found deceased in her hostel room at the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) University in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The government of Nepal formally requested a comprehensive investigation into the incident. The following day, a member of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Priyank Kanoongo, stated on social media that the student had reportedly died by suicide. He also referenced a prior case from 2024 involving the death of another Nepali student at the university, which had been subject to NHRC investigation. That earlier inquiry resulted in recommendations concerning student safety protocols. Implementation of those recommendations was stayed by the Orissa High Court after being legally contested by the university.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Suicide of Prakriti Lamsal', 'summary': 'On 16 February 2025, Nepali B.Tech student Prakriti Lamsal was found dead in her hostel at KIIT Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, in a suspected suicide.

Police arrested a male student in connection with the case, while the Nepali Embassy intervened. Investigations are ongoing amid rising tensions.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nPrakriti Lamsal was a student from Siddharthanagar, Bhairahawa, in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. She was pursuing her higher studies at the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. She was found dead in her hostel room on 16 February 2025 in what appeared to be a suicide.\\n\\n\\n== Incident ==\\nLamsal was found dead in her hostel room at the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology on 16 February 2025. Her body was discovered by her roommate, who became concerned after not hearing from her for a while. The roommate went to check on her and found Lamsal unresponsive. The incident was immediately reported to university authorities.\\nLamsal had last communicated with her family earlier that day, mentioning that she was heading to a campus event. Her father reported that she had called her mother at around 2:51 PM, sounding normal and mentioning her plans. However, later that afternoon, the family was informed by university authorities between 5 PM and 5:30 PM about her death.\\nDetails surrounding the exact method of her death have not been publicly disclosed, but the incident was classified as a suicide following the autopsy report.

Dhauli, near Bhubaneswar was the site of the Kalinga War (c.\\u2009262-261 BCE), in which the Mauryan emperor Ashoka invaded and annexed Kalinga. One of the most complete edicts of the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka, dating from between 272 and 236 BCE, remains carved in rock, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) to the southwest of the modern city. After the decline of the Mauryan empire, the area came under the rule of Mahameghavahana dynasty, whose most well-known ruler is Kharavela. His Hathigumpha inscription is located at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar. The area was subsequently ruled by several dynasties, including Satavahanas, Guptas, Matharas, and Shailodbhavas.\\n\\nIn the 7th century, Somavamshi or Keshari dynasty established their kingdom and constructed a number of temples. After the Kesharis, the Eastern Gangas ruled Kalinga area until the 14th century CE. Their capital was located in present-day Cuttack City. After them, Mukunda Deva of the Bhoi Dynasty – the last Hindu ruler of the area until the Marathas ruled Odisha from Cuttack. Most of the older temples in Bhubaneswar were built between 8th and 12th centuries, under Shaiva influence. The Ananta Vasudeva Temple is the only old temple of Vishnu in the city. In 1568, the Karrani dynasty of Afghan origin gained control of Odisha . During their reign, most of the temples and other structures were destroyed or disfigured.\\nIn the 16th century, the area came under pachamani Mughal control. The Marathas, who succeeded the Mughals in the mid-18th century, encouraged pilgrimage in Odisha. In 1803, the area came under British colonial rule and was part of the Bengal Presidency (until 1912), Bihar and Orissa Province (1912–1936) and Orissa Province (1936–1947). \\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary history ===\\nThe capital of the British-ruled and post-independent Orissa State was also Cuttack, which was vulnerable to floods and suffered from space constraints. Because of this, in September 1946, a proposal to move the capital to a new capital was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the Odisha Province. After independence of India, the foundation of the new capital was laid on 13 April 1948. The Legislative Assembly of Odisha was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar in 1949.

MACT started functioning in 1960 at Govt S.V. Polytechnic with an intake of 120 students and seven faculty members. It was one of the first out of eight Regional Engineering Colleges started during the second five-year plan (1956–1960) in India, where the main focus was development of the public sector and rapid industrialisation. \\n\\nTo ensure enough supply of trained personnel to meet the demand of rapid industrialisation, a decision was taken to start the Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), one in each major state of India to churn out graduates with good engineering merit. Thus a total of seventeen RECs were established 1959 onwards, one in each major state of India. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. MACT was one of the first eight REC\\'s to be established in each region in India. It was established in the Western Region along with Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat.\\nIt started operating in the premises  of \"Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic\" Bhopal. Mr. S. R. Beedkar, Principal of Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic was appointed as the planning officer of the institute. The foundation stone of the Institute building was laid by the then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 23 April 1961. The Institute gradually progressed to become a high level education center with steady development of infrastructure as well as academics. J. N. Moudgill became the first principal of MACT in 1962. Five years degree programs in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering were started in 1962 itself. In 1963, the five-year program of Bachelor of Architecture was started as well. In 1964, the institute was shifted to its own building which is its present campus. As the necessity of science and technology kept on growing, more undergraduate programs kept on getting added like: Electronics and Communications Engineering in 1972; Computer Science and Engineering in 1986;  3-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in 1988 and Information Technology in 2001 (which was later merged with \"Computer Science and Engineering\" in 2013).\\nThe success of technology-based industry led to high demand for technical and scientific education. During the Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Minister of Human Resource Development, Murli Manohar Joshi decided to upgrade all \"Regional Engineering Colleges\" to \"National Institutes of Technology\" that shall be funded by the Central Government itself. Hence, in 2002, all REC\\'s became NIT\\'s and MACT became Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT). In the same year, MANIT was granted deemed university status.

The ruins of a major ancient university, Puspagiri, were recently discovered in Odisha. Scholars from far away lands, such as Greece, Persia and China used to study philosophy, astronomy, mathematics and science at this famed university. Along with Takshashila and Nalanda universities, Puspagiri was among the oldest universities in the world. All three universities were mentioned by the Chinese traveler Huien Tsang (Xuanzang), who visited India in the 7th century, but unlike the others, the whereabouts of Puspagiri university were unknown until recently. As of 2007, the ruins of this university have not been fully excavated yet.\\nOdisha's education prospered under Hindu and Buddhist rule. However, it went into a period of decline under the Sun dynasty, after 1568. The Muslims and the Marathas, who occupied Odisha before the British, did little to spread education. Before the creation of modern Odisha, the mainstay of the education system were the Sanskrit Pathsalas, and the Maktabs, which existed in Cuttack, Balasore, Puri, Angul and Sambalpur, local Chatasalis to cater to grassroot level education, as well as advanced centers of Oriental learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Colonial era ===\\nThe colonialization of Odisha by the British East India Company in 1803 proved disastrous to Odisha in all spheres. It led to the collapse of the traditional education system. Yet, Odisha being one of the last Indian territories to come under the British rule became exposed much later than other parts of India to the system of education they introduced.  Under the East India Company, Christian missionaries who took up printing the Old and New Testaments in Odia, also contributed to some growth in education. The first primary school was created in 1822 by missionaries.\\nThe Cuttack Zilla school, Odisha's first modern school up to matriculation level, was established in 1866. It was extended to become a Collegiate school in 1868, which provided first and second year college education to Odia students. However, Odias were severely disadvantaged by having to attend Presidency College in Kolkata for B.A. degrees. This was until the collegiate branch of Zilla school was converted into a full bachelor's degree granting college under the then commissioner, T. E. Ravenshaw. This college was named as Ravenshaw College after him.\\nIn the early 20th Century, Gopabandhu Das established the 1st nationalist school in Odisha, the Satyabadi Bana Bidyalaya, following which Sayeed Mohammed established the second nationalist school of Odisha at Cuttack named the Muslim Seminary (present day : Sayeed Seminary). These nationalist schools aimed to cultivate the ideals of patriotism in the hearts of the students.\\nWomen's education was taken up with the establishment of the Ravenshaw Hindu Girls' School in 1873.

Later, Reba Ray, a former student of this school, Begum Badar un nissa Akhtar and Sailabala Das became instrumental in furthering the cause of women's education, leading to the creation of the Sailabala Women's College, Cuttack which was founded by Sailabala Das in the year 1913.\\nMedical education began with the opening of the first medi\"), Document(metadata={'title': 'Kao Kim Hourn', 'summary': \"Kao Kim Hourn  (Khmer: កៅ គឹមហួន, romanized: Kau Kœ̆m Huŏn [kaw kɨm huən]; born 28 May 1966) is a Cambodian diplomat who has served as the Secretary-General of ASEAN since 2023.

His mother, Sukanti, works as a caretaker in a hostel at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. His father died at an early age. He has three sisters: Rashmita, Nivedita and Sasmita.\\nAs a consequence of their poverty, Budhia Singh was allegedly sold by his mother to a travelling salesman for ₹850 at the age of two. Because of the ill-treatment thereafter, his mother sought out Biranchi Das, a local judo coach and orphanage operator, and asked him to take the boy on. Biranchi reimbursed the salesman\\'s purchase price of Singh and the child came to live with Das and his other orphans at a local Judo Hall. Singh\\'s mother disputes this version of events, saying \"We did not have anything but yet, I never sold [him].\" Singh himself claims that he met Das after attending his sister\\'s judo class, and that Das never ran an orphanage, although he did sometimes allow his students to stay at the gym. \\nOne day, Das caught Singh hitting his sister, Sasmita. He punished him by making him run, but then forgot about him; he returned after five hours to find Singh was still running. After a medical check up his heart was found to be normal even after running for hours. He then began to train him to run marathons. By the age of four, Budhia had run and completed 50 marathons. After running a record-breaking marathon, Budhia was admitted to the SAI sports hostel in Bhubaneswar.

The documentary was funded by HBO & BBC Storyville, and was nominated for an Emmy. In the film, Budhia makes a withdrawal of his accusations against Das.\\nSingh was no longer running long distances by the age of 13 in 2015, and was running one or two hours of conditional training per day.

According to police, Das was sitting inside the judo centre with friends after a training session at the time of the attack. Das\\'s murder was not related to his treatment of Singh; it resulted after Das incurred the wrath of a gangster, Raja Acharya, after Das reportedly tried to defend a model, Leslie Tripathy, who was allegedly being harassed by Raja.

The conflict reportedly began when law students objected to lewd comments being made to a female law student, leading to escalating tensions. On November 24, approximately 300 to 400 engineering students engaged in aggressive actions, including stone-pelting and assaults with wooden sticks, resulting in injuries to over 25 law students. The situation prompted authorities to evacuate nearly all 400 law students and several engineering students from the campus to prevent further violence.

The government of Nepal formally requested a comprehensive investigation into the incident. The following day, a member of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Priyank Kanoongo, stated on social media that the student had reportedly died by suicide. He also referenced a prior case from 2024 involving the death of another Nepali student at the university, which had been subject to NHRC investigation. That earlier inquiry resulted in recommendations concerning student safety protocols. Implementation of those recommendations was stayed by the Orissa High Court after being legally contested by the university.\n",
